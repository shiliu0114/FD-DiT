# FD-DiT
A frequency-domain directed diffusion transformer framework for Low-Dose CT (LDCT) reconstruction. FD-DIT integrates a generalized diffusion strategy with a multi-network architecture, employing sliding sparse local attention and learnable dynamic fusion to effectively decouple and restore high-frequency details and low-frequency structures
